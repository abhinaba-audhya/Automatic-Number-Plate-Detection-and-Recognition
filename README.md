Automatic-Number-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
================================================
This project is based on ANPR(Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and OCR(Optical Character Recognition) IMAGE PROCESSING 
algorithms. 
The main objective of the Project is to Detect the number plates from a still image, read the Letters from Number plate 
and thus identify the Vehicle . The Detection and Recognition part is stressed on in this project. The software is implemented
using MATLAB. Refer documentation for details.
